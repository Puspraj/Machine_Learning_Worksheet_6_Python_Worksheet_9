Question Number, Correct Option, Answer

1> b, No

2> a, Red

3> d, None of the above

4> b, Itâ€™s the classifier for which the margin length or the distance between the closest
      data-point on either side of the classifier and the classifier is maximized.

5> c, cannot be determined from the given data

6> a,  They are less sensitive to outliers and can be used even in their presence

7> a, They take the data from lower dimensional space to some higher dimensional
      space in case the data is not likely to be linearly separable. 

8> a,  These functions gives value of the dot product of pairs of data-points in the
       desired higher dimensional space without even explicitly converting the whole
       data in to higher dimensional space.

9> d, It is a model trained using supervised learning. It can be used for classification
      not for regression.

10> d, All of the above.

11>
